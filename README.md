# Tiny React Apps

## Background

Following the conclusion of my bootcamp experience with Northcoders I realised I needed to keep my React, CSS, JavaScript, logical thinking and problem solving skills sharp. I also could not start a huge project as so much of my time is invested in job hunting and also in learning a new language. Therefore, I decided to make use of a repository that was created for us by the bootcamp to work on mini-apps each weekend. Due to time constraints, the focus of these apps is on functionality first and design second.

So far, I have completed a to-do-list, noughts and crosses game and a calculator app.

## Running the apps

Navigate into the app you wish to run, for example:

```
cd xsnos
```

Install the relevnant dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Open up the app in your browser:

```
npm start
```
