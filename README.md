# Tiny React Apps

## Background

Following the conclusion of my bootcamp experience with Northcoders I realised I needed to keep my React, CSS, JavaScript, logical thinking and problem solving skills sharp. I also could not start a huge project as so much of my time is invested in job hunting and also in learning a new language. Therefore, I decided to make use of a repository that was created for us by the bootcamp to work on mini-apps each weekend. Due to time constraints, the focus of these apps is on functionality first and design second.

So far, I have completed a to-do-list, noughts and crosses game and a calculator app.

## Running the apps locally

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/abdullah7x/fe-tiny-react-apps.git`
2. `cd fe-tiny-react-apps`

Navigate into the app you wish to run, for example:

```
cd xsnos
```

Install the relevnant dependencies:

note: `V17` is the minimum version of node required to run this project locally.
